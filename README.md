🎮✨ NintenBlog ✨🎮

Welcome to NintenBlog, a fan-made website created straight from the heart of a lifelong Nintendo lover ❤️🎈
As a true Nintendo fanatic, I wanted to build a cozy corner on the internet where I could share fun facts, interesting topics, and everything that makes this company so magical. 🌟
In this project I was inspired by this website: https://dribbble.com/shots/25385098-Game-Website-UI-Dark-Mode-Interactive-Website ✨ Though, it didnt turn like it, it has the same topic.
Decored with photos, typical Nintendo colors and so much love in it, this is how I greet you to my page, Nintenblog 🩷



🍅⏱️ Study With Me – Pomodoro Edition!

I didn’t just want NintenBlog to be fun — I wanted it to be useful too!
That’s why I added a Pomodoro timer, so you can study or focus while hanging out on my page. Recently, I even added task management 📝 to the Pomodoro section so you can keep track of what you’re working on. Productivity + Nintendo? Yes please! 💪🎮
That's not all it has, since you can manage your own activities the way you want, editing them, deleting them, and it will automatically show in your pomodoro, ready for you to start your journay with positivity! And hey, dont forget the cool playlist 🤭



🕹️📜 Latest Update: “Consoles” Page

The most recent addition to NintenBlog is the Consoles page, where I give a quick overview of the many consoles Nintendo has released throughout its history — from classics to modern favorites! 🧡🕹️
There’s still more to add, but it’s already a fun little trip down memory lane.

🧩Future projects🧩

In the future, i would like to add more fun interactions releated to Nintendo on my page, more info about Nintendo and a bi community of fans that can chat about their favourite things in the social media! Thinking about adding news every week so you can be aware of everything Nintendo adds, so you can be the firts one to know (And maybe show off with your friends about it 😎)
