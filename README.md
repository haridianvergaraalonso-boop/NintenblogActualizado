🎮✨ NintenBlog ✨🎮

Welcome to NintenBlog, a fan-made website created straight from the heart of a lifelong Nintendo lover ❤️🎈
As a true Nintendo fanatic, I wanted to build a cozy corner on the internet where I could share fun facts, interesting topics, and everything that makes this company so magical. 🌟

🍅⏱️ Study With Me – Pomodoro Edition!

I didn’t just want NintenBlog to be fun — I wanted it to be useful too!
That’s why I added a Pomodoro timer, so you can study or focus while hanging out on my page. Recently, I even added task management 📝 to the Pomodoro section so you can keep track of what you’re working on. Productivity + Nintendo? Yes please! 💪🎮

🕹️📜 Latest Update: “Consoles” Page

The most recent addition to NintenBlog is the Consoles page, where I give a quick overview of the many consoles Nintendo has released throughout its history — from classics to modern favorites! 🧡🕹️
There’s still more to add, but it’s already a fun little trip down memory lane.

🚧⏳ Work in Progress

Some sections are still under construction due to lack of time 🫠💻 —
such as the Ranking page and the History page.
But don’t worry… they will be completed in the future! ✨⏳
